## âœ… Task 1: Generate GPG Key Pair

### Create RSA key pair 

Generate key with `gpg`.

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

- `--full-generate-key`: This tells GPG to guide you through a detailed key creation process.

- **Key Type:** RSA & RSA  
- **Key Size:** 4096 bits  
- **Expiry:** 1 year

#### Name:

## âœ… Task 2: Encrypt and Decrypt a File


### Create plaintext

```bash
echo "This file was encrypted by Aabas (NWS23010046)" > plaintext.txt
```

---

### Encrypt plaintext

```bash
gpg --encrypt --recipient maabas.mdsuji@student.gmi.edu.my plaintext.txt
```

- `--recipient` : gpg will find the key that has binded with the email like key id.
