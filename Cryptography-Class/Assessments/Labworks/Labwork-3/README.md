## 🧠 Lab Objectives

This lab introduces students to OpenSSL, a powerful open-source cryptographic toolkit. Students will explore core cryptographic operations including:

- Symmetric encryption (AES)
- Asymmetric encryption (RSA)
- Hashing (SHA-256)
- Digital signatures (RSA + SHA-256)

### Upon Completion, You Will Be Able To:

✅ Encrypt and decrypt files using symmetric and asymmetric methods  
✅ Generate and verify data hashes  
✅ Create and verify digital signatures

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks

You are required to research and use correct `OpenSSL` commands to:

1. **Symmetric Encryption** – using AES
2. **Asymmetric Encryption** – using RSA keys
3. **Hashing** – using SHA-256
4. **Digital Signatures** – sign and verify using RSA + SHA-256
